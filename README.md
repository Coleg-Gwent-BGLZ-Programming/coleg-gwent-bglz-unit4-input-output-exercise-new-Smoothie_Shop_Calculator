# 🥤 Smoothie Shop Calculator

Welcome to the Smoothie Shop coding challenge! In this task, you'll build a simple Python program to help a local smoothie shop calculate the total cost of a customer's order.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Practice using `input()` and `print()` for basic interaction
- Learn how to convert strings to numbers using `int()` and `float()`
- Use **formatted strings** to display clear and friendly output
- Apply your understanding in a real-world scenario

---

## 🧠 Scenario
You’ve been hired by a smoothie shop to create a program that:

1. Asks the customer for their **name**
2. Asks how many smoothies they want to buy
3. Calculates the total cost (each smoothie costs **£3.50**)
4. Displays a message showing:
   - The customer’s name
   - The number of smoothies
   - The total cost
---

## 📝 Instructions

1. Open the `main.py` file.
2. Write your code following the scenario above.
3. Use `input()` to collect user data.
4. Use `int()` or `float()` to convert input where needed.
5. Use `print()` and **formatted strings** to display the final message.
6. Test your program with different inputs.

## 💡 Example Output

Welcome to the Smoothie Shop!
What is your name? Chris
How many smoothies would you like to buy? 2
Thank you, Chris! Your total for 2 smoothies is £7.00.

## 🌟 Extension Challenge (Optional)

Add a feature that asks:
> "Would you like a reusable cup for £1.00 extra? (yes/no)"

If the customer says **yes**, add £1.00 to the total cost and update the final message.
